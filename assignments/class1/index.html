    <p>Hello! My name is Sara and I am a graphic and web designer. I love hiking, painting, designing, and pretty much everything. I live in Mevaseret Zion where my husband teaches in the Yeshiva. We had a beautiful baby boy about 7 weeks ago - our first - and his name is Hillel. He is adorable. I am orginally from St. Louis, and I made Aliya a year ago summer after finishing college and getting married.Check out my online portfolio at www.bilmesdesign.net.</p><button id="myButton">click me!</button>
